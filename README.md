## Installation and running:
Use a CLI (Terminal for MacOS, CMD/PowerShell for Windows) and use the below commands.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Downloading this repo:

Either use GitHub desktop or use your terminal to clone the repo.

```console
git clone git@github.com:RecEmptynez/frontend.git
```

## Commands

You'll need to use the following commands in the terminal:

* `cd path/to/this/directory` changes the directory to `path/to/this/directory`.
* `git clone https://github.com/...` clones repositories, write the URL to the repository you want to clone

### Change directory to this repo:
```console
cd path/to/this/directory
```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
```console
yarn start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```console
yarn test
```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

```console
yarn build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

```console
yarn eject
```
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### If something doesn't work
Make sure to be in the right directory (the same directory where the git repository is on your computer)

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
